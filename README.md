# RESonate
RESonate (Riverine Ecosystem Synthesis) geoprocessing methodology for rapid analysis and categorization of river systems based on hydrogeomorphic variables using ArcPy based scripts for use in ArcGIS.

The RESonate Tool is a semi-automated GIS-based process designed for ArcGIS that enables the rapid collection and processing of GIS data sources and geomorphic variable extraction. These variables embody fundamental geologic, climatic, and topographic characteristics of riverine landscapes, that can be quantified using freely available geospatial datasets, and are thought to be an ideal minimum set of variables to identify distinct river valley scale differences within a watershed.
